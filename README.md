# domino-etak
Repository for final project for AA228 (Decision-making under uncertainty)

*Note that we are using Python3.6*

# Running tests
Remember to add the current directory to your python path! The requirements.txt file contains the packages we're using (e.g. use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the files).

In order to run the tests, call `python tests/test_board.py` to get a sample game.
